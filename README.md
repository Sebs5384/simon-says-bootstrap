# Simon Says

Simon Says is a classic memory game where players have to repeat a sequence of colors or sounds. 
The game was developed in the class 10 of r/Argentina-programa as a project to improve programming skills.

# How to play

The game consists of a series of rounds, where the computer displays a sequence of colors or sounds that the player must repeat correctly. 
Each round increases the length of the sequence, making it more challenging. If the player makes a mistake, the game is over.

To start the game, the player must press the "Start" button. 
The computer will randomly select a color or sound to start the sequence. 
The player must then repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons or keys. 
If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the computer will add another color or sound to the sequence, and the game continues.

# Technologies used

The game interface was built using HTML and styled using CSS, JavaScript was used to program the game logic, including generating random sequences, playing sounds, and checking player input. 
In future updates we are going to work into changing the styles by adding bootstrap.
